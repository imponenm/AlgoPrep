# AlgoPrep
Repository for practicing questions from LeetCode.

Timeline so far:
1. Started easy questions to warm up and refresh myself on some common concepts.
2. Beginning to go through some individual concepts. completed LL's and Trees, still need to do recursion
3. Start doing mediums (some of the individual concept problems were med/hard, so I'm already kind of here)

Stoked to get back into this stuff :D
