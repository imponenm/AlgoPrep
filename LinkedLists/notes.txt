Linked Lists


Runtimes
---------
Adding a node: O(1)
All you have to do is set the next node of the node to be added and the previous node. If you're adding to the head,
you need to update the head. Also note that if you have to traverse the list to find an item before adding, the algo
will still be O(N). This is mostly just to note that the actual add operation is O(1)

Deleting a node: O(N)
We have to traverse the list to find our value to delete, hence O(N). Once you find it, you just have to change
the previous node's next pointer to be the deletion node's next value. Again, note there is slightly different handling
if the node is the head
